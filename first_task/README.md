# First Task
**Question**: 
1. Please write a simple CLI application in the language of your choice that does the following: Print the numbers from 1 to 10 in random order to the terminal. Please provide a README, that explains in detail how to run the program on MacOS and Linux.

**Answer**
- I have usued Bash for this task.
- The file **random_order.sh** has the code.
- The Application requires input of two numbers, start and end.
- If the Start or End value is not provided, it will take the dafault values. Plus it will print the message in terminal as well.
- Default values : Start = 1, End = 10
- The script works on both MacOS and Linux.

**Execution**

Scenario 1: You input Start and End Value:

`$> bash random_order.sh 50 60`

Scenario 2: You input No Start and End Value:

`$> bash random_order.sh`
